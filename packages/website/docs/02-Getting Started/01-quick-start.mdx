# Quick start

Add the Bento package to your project:

<PackageManagerCommand
  command={{
    pnpm: "add @buildo/bento-design-system",
    yarn: "add @buildo/bento-design-system",
    npm: "install @buildo/bento-design-system",
  }}
/>

Here's how an hello world looks like:

```ts
import "@buildo/bento-design-system/index.css";
import "@buildo/bento-design-system/defaultTheme.css";
import { BentoProvider, Title } from "@buildo/bento-design-system";
import { defaultMessages } from "./defaultMessages";

<BentoProvider defaultMessages={defaultMessages}>
  <Title size="large">Hello, World!</Title>
</BentoProvider>;
```

Let's break this down:

- in the first line we're importing Bento's own stylesheet. This is required for Bento to work correctly
- in the second line we're importing the default theme. This is the same theme used by the documentation,
  and it's useful to get started right away. We will see in the next secions how to customize the theme.
- in the third line we're importing some components from Bento.
- in the fourth line we're importing the default messages. This is not something provided by Bento, so we're assuming a `defaultMessages.ts` file exists in this case. More about this soon.
- finally we're putting this together and showing "Hello, World" on screen!

`BentoProvider` is a React context provider that is required for Bento components to work. You must wrap your application with it in order to use Bento.

`BentoProvider` has a required `defaultMessages` parameter: this is used to provide standard localized messages for some components.

  <summary>Why using default messages?</summary>

Bento components are entirely agnostic when it comes to localization: all components accept the
text to be display to the user as props.

Some specific props, however, are very repetitive and would be too tedious to pass them as props
every time you use the component. Think of messages like `"No options"` when a `SelectField` has no options to show or
accessibility labels like "Close", which are used to describe actions on icons.

Without the default messages, for example, you would need to pass `dismissButtonLabel` every time you use `Chip`:

```tsx
<Chip label={label} color={color} dismissButtonLabel={dismissButtonLabel} />
```

whereas default messages allow Bento to make `dismissButtonLabel` optional, and let you override it only if needed:

```tsx
// This uses the default message for `dismissButtonLabel`
<Chip label={label} color={color} />

// This overrides the default message
<Chip label={label} color={color} dismissButtonLabel={myCustomDismissLabel} />
```

  <summary>Here's some sample default messages you can use to get started:</summary>

<CodeBlock language="tsx" title="my-project/app/src/defaultMessages.ts">
  {defaultMessages}
</CodeBlock>
